This draft includes two of the four Descriptions we have in 802.3-2012.  These two reflect the two different perspectives:  the implementation of the bits/registers and management (perhaps remotely) looking at the bits/registers.For the implementation, ?Value always 0, writes ignored is acceptable?.  The ?Ignore on read? is the management perspective.  We are specifying the implementation (per the PICS), so the former Description should be used.(Per the PICS, an implementation is to return a 0 (better then always 0) and not be affected by (ignore) a write.  What we do not state is that management should ignore reserved bits on read and write reserved bits as 0.)~Replace multiple occurrences of ?Ignore on read? with ?Value always 0, writes ignored?.~~X~O"

One also for example can?t mix 40 Gb/s operation with a 100GBASE PHY as the second sentence arguably (though not logically) allows.
