The front matter should include a mention of IEEE Std 802.3.1.
CommentEnd:
SuggestedRemedy:
A companion document IEEE Std 802.3.1 describes Ethernet management information base (MIB) modules for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  IEEE Std 802.3.1 is updated to add management capability for enhancements to IEEE Std 802.3 after approval of the enhancements.

Formatting problem here (and in 802.3-2012).  It appears in the 2012 merge some insertions have the enumeration outdented as is the case for each enumeration here.
CommentEnd:
SuggestedRemedy:
Remove outdents per 802.3-2008 enumerations.

We have not done a good job on Reserved bits/registers.  This draft includes two of the four Descriptions we have in 802.3-2012.  These two reflect the two different perspectives:  the implementation of the bits/registers and management (perhaps remotely) looking at the bits/registers.

For the implementation, ?Value always 0, writes ignored is acceptable?.  The ?Ignore on read? is the management perspective.  We are specifying the implementation (per the PICS), so the former Description should be used.

(Per the PICS, an implementation is to return a 0 (better then always 0) and not be affected by (ignore) a write.  What we do not state is that management should ignore reserved bits on read and write reserved bits as 0.)
CommentEnd:
SuggestedRemedy:
Replace multiple occurrences of ?Ignore on read? with ?Value always 0, writes ignored?.

Warning is inappropriate:  From the IEEE Standards Style Manual, 17.4:  ?Warnings call attention to the use of materials, processes, methods, procedures, or limits that have to be followed precisely to avoid injury or death.?  I don?t think this even raises to the level of a Caution: ?Cautions call attention to methods and procedures that have to be followed to avoid damage to equipment.?

Use of acronyms not in 1.5.  FW is broadly used in this document, though primarily as part of variable names it is also used as an acronym.  DLL is also used in variable names and in clause 30 and 78 text.  TLV is in the definitions in 802.3-2012, but it isn?t listed in the acronyms.

SuggestedRemedy:
Add to 1.5:
DLL    data link layer
FW     fast wake
TLV    type, length, value

I think the title is referring to the echo of two fields within the TLV value, so proper field names should be used. Not sure if it should be Echo of Transmit FW and Receive FW or per Table 79-9 Echo Transmit FW and Echo Receive FW?

I believe it should be: Echo of Transmit FW and Receive FW

Their isn?t a 40 Gb/s MAC or a 100 Gb/s MAC, there is only one MAC with various operating speeds.  One also for example can?t mix 40 Gb/s operation with a 100GBASE PHY as the second sentence arguably (though not logically) allows.  This is also rather late in the clause to define 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet.  (Should have caught this on p802.3ba -- so a service to humanity.)
CommentEnd:
SuggestedRemedy:
Delete the second sentence.  And replace 80.1.1 first paragraph with:

This clause describes the general requirements for 40 Gigabit and 100 Gigabit Ethernet.  40 Gigabit Ethernet uses the IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer operating at a data rate of 40 Gb/s, connected through the 40 Gb/s Media Independent Interface to a 40 Gb/s Physical Layer implementation.  100 Gigabit Ethernet uses the IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer operating at a data rate of 100 Gb/s, connected through the 100 Gb/s Media Independent Interface to a 100 Gb/s Physical Layer implementation.
