This means that according to equations 93A-9 and 93A-10, S_11 and S_21 will have non-zero imaginary parts at DC, which is non-physical~Choose a set of rho and gamma values for Table 93A-2 which give rho_0 and gamma_0 values which have imaginary parts which are integer multiples of pi.  I suggest just zeroing the imaginary parts of rho_0 and gamma_0 currently in Table 93A-2 and making no other change, but i will accept any reasonable alternative.~~X~O"

The coefficient value are supposed to measure the transmitter independent of the channel.  I think that theproblem comes because the 50% zero crossing measured in step 4 changesdepending on the rise time of the signal and the amount of equalization.~Possible fixes could be:1.     Take three pulses of the shape of the linear fit pulse response but beginning at times tr-1*UI, tr, and tr=1*UI.  Weight them with coefficientsd(-1), d(0), d(1) respectively.  Sum them and adjust t0, d(-1), d(0), and d(1)to give the best LMS fit the equalized linear fit pulse response.  Use thepeak of the tr pulse as t0 in the sampling process in step 5.2.      Like the first part of 1 but do not re-sample, just use c(-1)=d(-1),c(0)=d(0), and c(1)=d(1).3.  Possibly some other.~~X~O"
