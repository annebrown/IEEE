SuggestedRemedy:
A companion document IEEE Std 802.3.1 describes Ethernet management information base (MIB) modules for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  IEEE Std 802.3.1 is updated to add management capability for enhancements to IEEE Std 802.3 after approval of the enhancements.

Delete the second sentence.  And replace 80.1.1 first paragraph with:

This clause describes the general requirements for 40 Gigabit and 100 Gigabit Ethernet.  40 Gigabit Ethernet uses the IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer operating at a data rate of 40 Gb/s, connected through the 40 Gb/s Media Independent Interface to a 40 Gb/s Physical Layer implementation.  100 Gigabit Ethernet uses the IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer operating at a data rate of 100 Gb/s, connected through the 100 Gb/s Media Independent Interface to a 100 Gb/s Physical Layer implementation.
